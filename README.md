> ‚ú® Torrent downloads

> ‚ú® Matched to metadata shamelessly stolen from [SpykerNZ/one-pace-for-plex](https://github.com/SpykerNZ/one-pace-for-plex)  

---

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Install Go** (version ‚â• 1.23)

1. Clone repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tissla/opforjellyfin.git
    cd opforjellyfin
    ```

1. Build binary:

    ```bash
    go build -o opfor
    ```

## üîß Usage (Start Here!)

1. Set your download directory before doing anything else. All your metadata will be stored here, and downloads will be matched to their proper folders.

    ```bash
    ./opfor setDir "/media/One Piece/One Pace"
    ```

1. Find all available episodes with 'list', or use the -t flag to specify a title, or -r flag to specify a key-range.

    ```bash
    ./opfor list
    ./opfor list -t Wano
    ./opfor list -r 15-20
    ```

1. Download a torrent by using the downloadkey, displayed in front of the title. You can download one or multiple at the same time.

    ```bash
    ./opfor download 15 16 17
    ```

## üì¶ Metadata

I hope to continually update [metadata here!](https://github.com/tissla/one-pace-jellyfin)

The 'sync' command allows the user to stay up to date with new additions to the metadata-repo.

### Steps to make sure Jellyfin doesn't mess with the metadata:

1. Create a library with no metadata-fetchers active just for One Pace. Disable all of them!

1. Make sure the show is **unlocked** for changes.

1. Run ```./opfor sync``` again if Jellyfin messed up your .nfo files before this.

1. Rescan library with **unlocked** metadata and *no fetchers active*.
